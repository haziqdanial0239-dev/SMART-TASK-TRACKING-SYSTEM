1. What planning activity helped most in monitoring progress?

One of the most helpful planning activities for me was setting clear milestones and including a cost buffer in the baseline. Having those milestones gave me a clear roadmap to follow and made it much easier to track whether the project was moving as expected. When unexpected expenses came up, such as the need for extra cloud storage or preprocessing tools, the cost buffer provided flexibility without putting the overall budget at risk. This combination of milestone clarity and financial preparedness helped me quickly identify deviations, especially when data collection started to fall behind schedule. It reinforced how important it is to have both time and cost safeguards in place before execution begins.

2. What would you do differently in future projects?

If I were to plan this project again, I would definitely allocate more time for data‑related tasks. The Smart Tracking System project showed me that acquiring and cleaning datasets is not only time‑consuming but also prone to unexpected delays, such as permissions, formatting issues, and preprocessing requirements. These challenges slowed down progress and created bottlenecks that affected later tasks like model design and training. To avoid this in the future, I would prepare backup datasets or even synthetic data earlier in the project, so that work can continue even if the primary sources are unavailable. Taking a more proactive approach to risk mitigation would make the project timeline more realistic and ensure smoother execution overall.
