1. What planning activity helped most in monitoring progress?

The planning activity that helped most in monitoring progress was the use of the planned versus actual progress tracking table. By assigning each task a planned percentage and comparing it with the actual percentage completed, it became easy to identify which tasks were progressing well and which were falling behind. This clear comparison highlighted deviations early, especially in areas such as data collection and model design, allowing the team to quickly determine where corrective actions were needed.

2. What would you do differently in future projects?

In future projects, I would plan more realistically by ensuring adequate manpower is assigned to labour-intensive tasks and by evaluating the skill levels of team members earlier to determine if additional training or support is needed. I would also include more buffer time in the schedule, especially for complex phases such as data collection and model design, to prevent delays from cascading into later tasks. Additionally, I would refine the project scope at the beginning to clearly separate essential requirements from optional enhancements, ensuring that the team can focus on core deliverables before attempting additional features.
