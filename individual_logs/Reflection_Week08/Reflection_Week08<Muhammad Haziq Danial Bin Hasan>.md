1. What planning activity helped most in monitoring progress?
   Establishing clear milestones combined with a strategic cost buffer provided a reliable roadmap for tracking progress while ensuring financial flexibility to handle unexpected technical needs.

2. What would you do differently in future projects?
   I would allocate more time for data acquisition and cleaning while preparing backup or synthetic datasets early to prevent preprocessing delays from bottlenecking the development cycle.
