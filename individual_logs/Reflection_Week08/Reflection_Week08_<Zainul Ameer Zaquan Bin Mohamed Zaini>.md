1. What planning activity helped most in monitoring progress?

The creation of a detailed Task Schedule with specific Due Dates and WBS IDs was the most effective activity for tracking progress. By assigning deadlines to milestones like Model Training (due Nov 15) and Dashboard Development (due Nov 28), the team could easily identify if the project was on track or falling behind schedule. Furthermore, having clearly defined Resource Names and Hours in the Resource Plan allowed for better accountability by showing exactly who was responsible for each 5 to 10-hour task block.


2. What would you do differently in future projects?

In future projects, I would improve the Cost Plan by replacing flat-rate estimates for Software and Evaluation with more precise hourly breakdowns to better justify the total RM 2,000 budget. I would also implement stricter Task Dependencies to ensure chronological logic, as the current plan shows Model Evaluation being completed on October 27, which is the same day the project started and prior to the completion of Model Training. Finally, I would allocate a specific time buffer for the GPU Model Training phase to account for potential hardware or technical delays.
