1. Why is identifying the critical path important for project managers?

Identifying the critical path is important because it shows the sequence of activities that directly determines the project duration, and any delay in these activities will delay the entire project.

2. Which activity posed the highest scheduling risk?

The model training activity (A4.1) posed the highest scheduling risk because it required the longest duration and depended on the completion of all prior tasks, making it more vulnerable to delays caused by technical or resource issues.

3. What trade-offs are involved when crashing a project?

Crashing a project involves trade-offs such as increased cost, additional workload, and potential quality risks in exchange for reducing the overall project duration.
