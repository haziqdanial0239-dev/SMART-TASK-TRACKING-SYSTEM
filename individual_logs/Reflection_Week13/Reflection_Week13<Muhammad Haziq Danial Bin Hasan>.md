1. Critical Path Importance: It identifies the longest sequence of tasks that must be completed on schedule to prevent the entire project from being delayed.

2. Highest Scheduling Risk: Activities with multiple predecessors or very little float pose the highest risk because any delay in those tasks—or the paths feeding into them—immediately impacts the final deadline.

3. Crashing Trade-offs: Crashing involves trading increased project costs and higher risks of quality issues or team burnout for a shorter overall project duration.
