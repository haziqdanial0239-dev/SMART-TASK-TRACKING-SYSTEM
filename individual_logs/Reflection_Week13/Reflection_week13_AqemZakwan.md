# Reflection Log W13 - AQEM ZAKWAN BIN AHMAD

### 1. Why is identifying the critical path important for project managers?

Identifying the critical path is important because it shows which activities directly impact the project completion date. Any delay in critical path activities will delay the entire project. This helps project managers focus their attention and resources on the most time-sensitive tasks and know where they have flexibility with non-critical activities.

### 2. Which activity posed the highest scheduling risk?

Activity **A2.1 (Data Collection)** posed the highest scheduling risk. Data collection takes 7 days and depends on external sources or availability of data, which can be unpredictable. Delays in obtaining the right dataset could push back the entire project timeline since all subsequent activities depend on having the data ready.

### 3. What trade-offs are involved when crashing a project?

The main trade-offs when crashing a project include:

- **Cost vs. Time:** Reducing duration usually requires additional resources (extra team members, cloud computing power, premium tools), which increases project costs.
- **Quality vs. Speed:** Rushing activities can lead to lower quality outputs, such as less thorough testing or incomplete documentation.
- **Team stress:** Accelerated schedules can cause team burnout and reduced morale, affecting long-term productivity.
