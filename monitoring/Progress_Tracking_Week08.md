## Performance Analysis

1.	Which tasks show the largest deviation from plan?
Data collection shows the biggest deviation from planned progress at 80% to actual progress at 60%. Model design also shows a 15% lower progress than its predicted percentage 
3.	What are the possible causes?
Lack of manpower in the data collection task as data collection requires high manpower for high amount of data. lack of knowledge in are also affects the model design task
4.	Are the issues related to scope, cost, resources, or risks identified earlier?
yes the risks indentified does mention the lack of manpower in doing certain tasks and lack of experience in the field
