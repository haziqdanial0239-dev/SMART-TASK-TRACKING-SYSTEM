Resouce Allocation
Issue Addressed:

Data Collection is behind schedule (planned 80% vs actual 60%).

Cause: Lack of manpower for high-volume data collection.

Action:
Reallocate additional team members temporarily to assist with data collection.
If manpower cannot be increased, redistribute non-critical tasks from overloaded members to others with lighter workloads.

Expected Impact:

Increases the speed of data gathering.

Reduces bottleneck effect on Model Design and Model Training, which rely heavily on complete data.

Schedule and Scope Refinement
ssue Addressed:

Model Design is behind (planned 70% vs actual 55%).

Causes: Lack of experience/knowledge in model design.

Action:
Adjust the schedule by extending the Model Design timeline slightly and shifting some later tasks forward like drafting report sections that do not depend on final results.
In parallel, refine the scope for the model design task by prioritizing essential components only like core features first → advanced enhancements later if time allows.

Expected Impact:

Reduces pressure on inexperienced team members.

Ensures core model functionality is delivered on time even if enhancements must be trimmed.

Helps project maintain overall timeline to reach December milestones.
